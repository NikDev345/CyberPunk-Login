# Design Decisions

## Why Cyberpunk Theme
The cyberpunk aesthetic was chosen to explore futuristic interface design while maintaining usability.

## State-Driven UI
All UI behavior is driven by explicit states rather than chained animations to avoid unpredictable behavior.

## Performance Considerations
- No external animation libraries
- Canvas background isolated from UI interaction
- Pointer-events carefully managed

## Scope Control
Feature development was intentionally stopped to preserve clarity and avoid over-engineering.
